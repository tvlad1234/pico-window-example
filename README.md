# pico-window-example
Example project using the [pico-window](https://github.com/tvlad1234/pico-window) multitasking environment\
It runs four example programs: a Fibonacci sequence generator, a program which adds two numbers, a sticky note in which you can simply type text and another one which just prints Hello world in multiple colours.
